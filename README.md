# Similarity of shallow and deep earthquakes in seismic moment release

---
This repository contains codes written and used by 
[Xin Cui](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~qw1009/) 
for classification and of shallow and deep earthquake, and intermediate-depth and deep-focus earthquake. Based on the classification result, the codes show the quantitative relationship between the distinguishable characteristics with focal depth and Earthâ€™s rigidity.

## Requirement
The script require python and some commonly used packages.

## Data
The data All_data_feature.csv is extracted from an open database SCARDEC, which is available at http://scardec.projects.sismo.ipgp.fr/

## Run the script
You can run the test code as:
```
python RF.py
```
This will return the results and save them in ./out directory.
